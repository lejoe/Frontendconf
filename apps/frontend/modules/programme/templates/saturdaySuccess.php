    <h3>Unconference</h3>
    The Unconference consists of sessions proposed and scheduled by attendees during the intro session. So on this Saturday all participants are encouraged to actively contribute. You can introduce your topic in one or two sentences during the intro session, if people are interested in it you will get a slot. We all have something to say about our experiences. There will be fifteen 45 minutes slots available for participants to present or facilitate a session. Looking forward to all suggestions!
